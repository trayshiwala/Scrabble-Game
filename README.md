# Features:

1. Interactive Tile Rack
Random Tile Generation: The tile rack generates a set of seven random letter tiles each time the game starts or is reset.
Draggable Tiles: Each letter tile in the rack is draggable, allowing players to pick and place tiles onto the game board.

2. Dynamic Game Board
Board Layout: The game board consists of a single row with various types of tiles, including regular tiles, double letter score tiles, and double word score tiles.
Drop Targets: Each tile on the board acts as a drop target, where players can place their letter tiles.

3. Special Score Tiles
Double Letter Score: Tiles placed on blue tiles have their letter value doubled.
Double Word Score: Tiles placed on pink tiles trigger a multiplier that doubles the score of the entire word.

4. Scoring System
Score Calculation: The score is dynamically calculated as players place tiles on the board.
Accurate Scoring: The game accurately calculates the score by considering both letter values and special score tiles (double letter and double word).

5. Game Controls
Reset Game: A reset button allows players to start a new game, which clears the board and regenerates a new set of random tiles in the rack.

6. User-Friendly Interface
Visual Indicators: Special tiles (double letter and double word) are visually distinct with background colors and text, enhancing gameplay clarity.
Score Display: The current score is prominently displayed and updates in real-time as tiles are placed on the board.

# EXTRA CREDIT feature:

Tile Mobility
Moveable Tiles: Players can move placed tiles around on the board or back to the rack, allowing for flexibility in word formation and strategic placement.
